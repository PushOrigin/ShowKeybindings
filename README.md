Exports all your keybindings to a document that's easy to read for you reference. It exports all shortcuts, including your custom assigned shortcuts as well as shortcuts added by extensions. Can export in both text, HTML, and JSON formats.

Find the **My Keyboard Shortcuts** command in the top-level **Help** menu.

## How can I help?

If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a ★★★★★ rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.

Another way to help out is to [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/madskristensen).
